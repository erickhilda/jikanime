1. Initial project setup (manually):
    - Bootstrapped with Vite + React + TypeScript
    - Installed dependencies: react, react-dom, react-router-dom, @reduxjs/toolkit, react-redux, tailwindcss, lucide-react
    - Configured ESLint and Prettier for code style and linting.
    - Created project file structure (components, pages, store, services, types directories).
    - Set up Tailwind CSS and configured theme/styles.
2. Feed the requirement from notion to chat, to generate plan.
3. Implement the plan -> get the basic working code for searching and displaying details.
4. Refine some ui details manually.
5. Add functionality to display initial anime data during initial load:
    - **prompt**: "Now I want to display the top anime data in the UI when the user first loads the page. If the user has already searched for an anime, display the search results."
    - **result**: get the working code to display initial anime data, and does some manual fixing since the result made the search not working.
